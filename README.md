## Sertifie.me - Verifiable Credentials For Your Events

- Users can create profiles with their information.
- Organizations can be created by users and can create sub-identities (admins) for validating attendees.
- Organizations can create events.
  - Event data is stored for certifications.
- Attendees can attend events via an application (InÄ±tially scanning a QR code).
  - Attendees's time is recorded (in and out).
  - At the end of each event, users scan a final QR code to declare their attendance and get their certificate.

## Get Started
If you don't have Truffle, install it:\
`$ npm i -g truffle`

If you don't have Ganache, download it from https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache

Create a new Ethereum workspace in Ganache UI (Quickstart Ethereum) and set its port number to `7545`

Add a new network to Metamask (Localhost 7545)

```
Network Name: Localhost 7545

New RPC URL: HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545

Chain ID: 1337

Currency Symbol: ETH
```

Open Ganache and then open a terminal in the root folder:\
`$ cd blockchain`

`$ npm install`

`$ npm run migrate`

Copy the deployed `Users` contract address, create a `.env` file under `frontend` folder and set the address as `VUE_APP_USERS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable.

After that, open `blockchain/build/contracts` folder and copy `abi` in `Users.json` file. Paste it inside `frontend/abi/Users.json`.
```
/// frontend/abi/Users.json

"abi": [
  {
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      {
        "indexed": true,
        "internalType": "address",
        "name": "addr",
        "type": "address"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
]
```

---

Open a new terminal in the root folder:\
`$ cd frontend`

`$ npm install`

`$ npm run serve`

Now, you can start using it!
